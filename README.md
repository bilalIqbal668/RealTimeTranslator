# INMO Real Time Translator
ANDROID APP that can RECOGNIZE ANY LIVE AUDIO STREAMING (using free VOSK Speech Recognition API) then TRANSLATE it (using unofficial ONLINE Google Translate API) and display them as Real timw text.

In my opinion this translate methode gives a better accuracy, and also it has more languages support compared to MLKIT Translate API. I have created it for INMO AIR glasses. It supports 15+ speech recognition languages and translate it into more than 50+ languages
